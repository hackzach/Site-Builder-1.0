This code repository is only a prototype. Many of the coding practices used inside are bad practice, buggy, or 
plain wrong. However, much understandings of development can come from seeing how other people develop, therefore it is
valuable to see even "bad" code. But be warned, this code is not meant for production. Study it. Play with it. Enjoy it. 
But don't expect it to run out of the box, because it won't. I will also post the beta version when I have finished securing 
testing it, and the current version is modularized. This one isn't. Have fun, but remember that if you were to try to use
some of the practices I used back then, many companies would laugh at you(maybe not, but this definately is not the best
method to develop under). 

I posted this so that those who do want to learn can see what a "project" looks like, look at code and say, "That looks
Horrible. I think I could do it better THIS way." and we can argue which methods would be best, and why. 

If you want to get further information, contact me at zacharyp dot com at gmail dot com, or through Github. 


Some third party files may have been losely thrown into the repo as well. They will be removed from teh final product, and
those wishing to get the original programs can find most of them by typing their name into Google. If you don't want your 
program in here anymore, contact me. I am still learning how to use Github, only reason why they are here in the first place.
Sorry guys. :(
